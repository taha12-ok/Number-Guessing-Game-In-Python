## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Setup the Game**:
- Set your desired number range
- Choose a difficulty level
- Click "Start New Game" to begin

2. **Make Your Guess**:
- Enter a number within the specified range
- Receive feedback (too high/too low)
- Use strategic thinking to narrow down the possibilities

3. **Use Hints Strategically**:
- Access up to 3 hints per game

- Analyze your performance statistics
- Try to improve your strategy over time

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Use binary search strategy (start with the middle of the range)
- Pay attention to patterns in your guesses
- Use hints strategically when you're stuck
- Try to minimize both attempts and time for the highest scores

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Altair**: Interactive statistical visualizations

## 🧠 Game Logic

The game generates a random number within your specified range. Your goal is to guess this number in as few attempts as possible. After each guess, you'll receive feedback telling you if your guess is too high or too low.

The scoring system takes into account:
- The size of the number range
- The number of attempts used
- The time taken to solve the puzzle
- The number of hints used

## 🔜 Future Enhancements
